Usagi is a data discovery system for Recruitâ€™s internal infrastructure. Usagi crawls metadata within Recruit's web services every day and builds a catalog of data sets. Usagi enables users to search, monitor, and annotate the metadata which helps them discover the appropriate data to perform analysis.

Many large enterprises today witness an explosion in the number of data sets.  Therefore, we aim to make Usagi open source. We hope Usagi helps data-users in these enterprises discover meaningful data easily.  The members who invent Usagi are contributors of Meta-Looking in Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd. and GOODS [1].
