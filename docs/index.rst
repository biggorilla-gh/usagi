Usagi Documentation
=================================

Usagi is a data discovery system that crawls metadata from data sources and builds a catalog of data sets. Usagi enables users to search, monitor, and annotate the metadata which helps them discover the needed data to perform analysis.
Usagi is part of the `BigGorilla <http://biggorilla.org>` project which provides tools for data integration and data preparation.
